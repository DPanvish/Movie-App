# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Appwrite: saved_movies collection schema

Create a collection (table) named saved_movies in your Appwrite database with the following attributes and indexes so it works with the save/list/delete helpers:

Attributes (columns)
- movie_id: integer (required)
  - TMDB numeric movie id used for de-duplication and lookups.
- title: string (required)
  - Movie title stored for quick display.
- poster_url: string (required)
  - Pre-built TMDB poster URL. Can be an empty string when no poster is available.
- createdAt: integer (required)
  - Unix epoch milliseconds (number). Used for sorting newest first.
- device_id: string (required)
  - A per-device identifier used to scope saved movies when the app has no auth.

Recommended indexes
- by_movie_device (key index) on [movie_id, device_id]
  - Speeds up queries like: Query.equal("movie_id", <id>), Query.equal("device_id", <deviceId>), Query.limit(1).
- by_device_createdAt (key index) on [device_id, createdAt]
  - Speeds up listSavedMovies: Query.equal("device_id", <deviceId>), Query.orderDesc("createdAt").
- Optional: Make by_movie_device a unique index to enforce one saved record per movie per device.

Permissions
- If you rely on device_id scoping (no user auth), you can set collection-level permissions to allow reads and writes for anyone, or use an API key. In production, prefer authenticated users and store user_id instead of device_id.

Environment variables needed
- EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_SAVED_TABLE_ID: The collection ID for saved_movies.
- EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID: Your Appwrite database ID.

Types in code
- The SavedMovieDoc interface in interfaces/interfaces.d.ts mirrors these attributes and is used by the client helpers.
